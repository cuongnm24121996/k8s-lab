# Keycloak 2FA SMS Authenticator

Keycloak Authentication Provider implementation to get a 2nd-factor authentication with a OTP/code/token send via SMS (through AWS SNS).

_Demo purposes only!_

Unfortunately, I don't have a real readme yet.
Blame on me!

But, for now, you can at least read my **blog post** about this autenticator here:

Or, just watch my **video** about this 2FA SMS SPI:
